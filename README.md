# FAC React Workshop

**Disclaimer: this workshop is outdated and unmaintained. It hasn't changed since 2018, so I strongly recommend using my new [Learn React](https://github.com/oliverjam/learn-react) workshop instead.**

An introductory workshop for FAC students to learn about React.

## Contents

1. [React elements](/01-dom-begone)
2. [Functional components](/02-component-proponent)
3. [Class-based components](/03-surpass-with-class)
4. [Forms in React](/04-storm-the-form)
5. [Stopwatch Workshop](/workshop-top-notch-stopwatch)

### Note

We'll be writing our code in a single `index.html` file for now. There are three scripts included on the page: React, ReactDOM and Babel. The first two expose `React` and `ReactDOM` as globals. The Babel script allows us to use a special `<script type="text/babel">` to have our JS 'transpiled' into standard ES5. This will let us write ES6 and other React specific syntax.

This set-up is simpler to jump into without having to learn about complex build-systems when you are really trying to learn React. It also demonstrates that React isn't something magical that requires modern JS and WebPack etc. It's just a JavaScript library that you can include in an HTML page.

This is in no way a best practice, so please don't build a real app this way :)

We'll look at Bundlers a bit later on, and will eventually modularise our code using [Parcel](http://parceljs.org/).

## Bonus Reading

If you're finished early check out these entries in the React Docs. They give a slightly higher-level look at how you should think about building React apps:

1. [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
2. [Thinking In React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
